Engineering Progression Framework v3.0
Initial remarks
This is an evolution of our engineering progression framework. This document is a perpetual work-in-progress, and will never be
“done”. There are a few guiding pillars for engineering progression at Monzo:
●

We will focus on the impact an individual engineer can have on driving Monzo forwards, rather than specific behaviours

●

Scope is an additional measure for different levels of seniority. As Monzo grows, so should the size or reach of the problems
we encounter as engineers.

●

We have aimed to consolidate behaviours down into essentials. This framework does not intend to be an exhaustive list of
everything an engineer does or can do, but instead articulates the important distinctions between levels.

●

Behaviours should be broad enough to factor in the numerous different ways an engineer can contribute effectively. As an
example: we should not list specific tasks such as “writes complex RPC handlers” but instead articulate the standards of
technical contribution we should expect from engineers of different levels. As a result, our framework will need more
interpretation, and is likely to be ineffective when used independently without your manager. We do not wish to create an
exercise that can be “checkboxed” to completion.

●

We wish to do away with levelling exercises or calculations. Attempting to boil performance and progression down to
numbers and equations is lazy, and leaves little room for the different ways engineers can add value. Instead we rely on
managers to clearly articulate how an engineer is meeting the scope and impact of each level, and that they are aligning with
our technical principles as a company.

●

We do not wish to have separate frameworks for each discipline. Our framework should focus on the practice of engineering
itself, it should not matter which programming language you choose to use.

1

Levels are cumulative. Particularly within the technical skill and behaviours categories, we expect engineers to be demonstrating the
contents of previous levels in addition to their own level. As an example: We expect Engineers II to also be proactively testing their
work, despite this being an Engineer I behaviour.

Impact
Impact is the main driver for progression at Monzo. Put simply, impact measures your sphere of influence and individual input on our
success as a business, through contributing to Monzo’s mission and goals. The area of the business you work in may mean you can
have impact in different ways - for instance through contributing to growth, helping with efficiency or cost reduction, meeting
regulatory requirements, or more. You may also have impact in other indirect ways, for example improving engineering practices, or
helping others to grow.
Focusing on impact enables us to reward engineers who “get stuff done” without them needing to perform specific routines. We
believe impact results from the combination of building technical skill, having the opportunity to demonstrate it, learning from that
experience over time, and coupling it with important behaviours and core skills.

Excellence here looks like
●

The work you choose to do drives team, discipline and business goals forward (relevant to the scope of your role).

●

You proactively identify opportunities to further goals within engineering, and bring clarity to opportunities in order to prioritise
them.

●

You “get things done”. You work for the team, and are regarded as a highly effective contributor by your peers.

Technical Skills
This aspect is about how you apply your technical skills and hone your craft, and documents the type of behaviours that measure the
effectiveness of an engineer’s technical contribution at different levels of complexity and ambiguity. Think of this as “how you do your
work”.

2

Our previous iteration was called “Mastery”, and focussed on discrete behaviours. We found this led to engineers “checkboxing” their
progression, and was often overly specific to certain areas of the business. Behaviours in this area should not detract engineers from
doing what is most impactful for their team and Monzo. Instead, this iteration focuses on measuring technical contribution via
quality, testability, performance and ability to design and critique designs. Your technical skills will gradually scale and improve with
experience.

Excellence here looks like
●

Your code and technical contribution is regarded as high quality by your peers and those above you in the framework.

●

You can efficiently design systems to solve business problems, and can resolve ambiguity, both at the technical and product
level.

●

Your systems are designed with the appropriate level of complexity for the problem at hand. Your software is as simple as
possible, but no simpler.

●

Your work is resilient, well tested and scales to meet customer growth expectations

Behaviours
Behaviours are a collection of expectations and development areas for engineers that do not fall into the categories of technical skill
and impact. They encompass a range of core skills that we expect engineers at Monzo to embody.
In the previous iteration of our framework these were further broken down into influence, communication and leadership, however in
this iteration we’re bringing them together.
Through your behaviour you set an example to those around you. By modelling great behaviours you lead by example, and by being
self-aware you know when you are setting a great example. Your behaviours show that you’re growing good habits, and cultivating
qualities that make an excellent engineer, rather than unintentionally doing the “right thing” by luck.

Usage of the progression framework
How the framework should be used
The purpose of this document, and associated framework is to guide conversations around performance and progression between
managers and engineers. This articulates the expectations of each broad level, the level of impact we expect individuals to bring to
business problems, and the manner in which engineers should be conducting their work. This document is not designed to be useful
as a standalone tool. This is a compass, not a GPS.
Progression from one level to the next will be a conversation between the individual and their manager. To reiterate, this should not
be seen as a checkbox exercise. Some individuals may move up a level without having experienced certain skills or behaviours, whilst
also giving confidence that they’re meeting the level above. In other situations a controlling weakness may prevent the individual
moving forwards. The framework does not intend to codify every possible situation, instead laying out expectations in broad strokes.
For any promotion cases, managers and engineers will together need to be able to articulate clearly how the engineer has
demonstrated the required impact for the level they are being promoted to, and should have demonstrated experience in the related
technical skill and behaviours in order to have that impact.
We will document the promotions process separately.

How the framework should not be used
This framework should not be used to mathematically calculate level. Different behaviours are important in different ways, and
attempting to create algorithms or formulae to support conversations naively assumes that each behaviour is important to different
parts of the business in the same way. In the past “levelling exercises” have been used to quantify progression, but going forwards
this should not be the approach.

Framework
The levels below represent a career’s worth of progression through engineering at Monzo.

4

Levels are broadly cumulative, each one building on what comes before.Engineer I (Level 20)

Engineer I (Level 20)
Scope:

✅ Task

Summary: A new engineer, with high potential, picking up the fundamentals they need to be successful in their team.
“Engineer I” engineers are at the start of their software engineering career. They’re working on well-defined tasks and are supported
by the team when stuck. They’re expected to ask lots of questions! As someone progresses toward “Engineer II” they should start to
gain confidence to pick up larger or less well-defined tasks with less required support.
Impact

Engineer II (Level 30)
Scope:

✅ Task

Summary: A productive and reliable engineer working effectively within a team
This level defines engineers who have learned the ropes, and are building the foundation to being solid individual contributors at
Monzo. Engineer II engineers are focussed on tasks assigned to them within their team, typically working with the support of other
engineers to reliably deliver these*.
We expect all “Engineer I” and “Engineer II” engineers at Monzo to show a positive trajectory towards “Engineer III”, and generally
expect people to progress from “Engineer II” to “Engineer III” within the course of 1-2 years at Monzo.
* Many teams at Monzo have fewer mobile engineers than other disciplines. Because of this, we may expect mobile engineers to be
able to work independently in a team from the “Engineer II” level.
Impact

Delivers tasks and designs effective solutions to product features or small scope engineering challenges in their area of the
business.
Makes steps towards independently owning the development of a feature, or problem space, including the ability to identify, define,
and scope problems.

and evidence of actioning them.

7

Engineer III (Level 40)
Scope:

🎨 Project or feature

Summary: A strong individual contributor. Responsible for the entire lifecycle of a project or feature
“Engineer III” defines a solid individual contributor at Monzo, able to take on any technical problem related to their discipline or
domain confidently, and can clearly articulate how they’re working with others to help their team reach its goals. While we don’t
expect any engineer to work alone, “Engineer III” engineers are highly independently capable, and can lead on the design and
implementation of a feature or project. An “Engineer III” engineer not only delivers their own work, but also demonstrates the ability to
bring up others around them, for example through activities such as onboarding engineers into their team, or mentoring less
experienced engineers working with them. They’re engaged in the challenges, opportunities and risks faced by their team, collective
and discipline – taking part in the initiatives where they’re best placed to help.
Our expectation is that all Monzo engineers are capable of reaching the “Engineer III” level within an appropriate timescale (see
previous levels), but they may not wish to take on additional responsibilities beyond this level, and that’s OK. Giving an indication of
how long we expect progression through any level is hard, it's always on a case-by-case basis (depending on individual performance and
impact), but we most commonly see 1-2 years.

10

Senior Engineers (Senior I and Senior II)
Senior Engineers come in different ‘shapes’ and depending on their individual situation, someone may skew more heavily towards
certain behaviours or others.
●

At one end of the continuum we have the tech lead, a person that fosters engineering culture for their team, highly impactful
at building performant systems that scale and meet customer needs, encouraging and supporting their team to build software
that is high quality and tested sufficiently. It’s important to note that some engineers may wear the tech lead hat before they
reach the “Senior I” level, but not yet be meeting the level expectations in other ways; Senior and tech lead are not
synonymous.

●

The other end of the scale has the domain expert, who is a collective wide subject matter expert in one or more areas,
whether that’s a set of complex services or problems, such as Mastercard, or a particular technology such as Kafka. The
domain expert drives technology forward for Monzo, and is typically the person to lead on systems design in that area,
sharing proposals to level up others with their work.

●

In between will be people who are technically competent, excellent team members and highly productive but none of whom
are a specific 'expert' in a particular thing or want to be a tech lead. Engineers in this group would leverage their technical and
behavioural competencies, alongside their high levels of productivity, to effectively lead projects to successful outcomes for
their team and collective. They are taking the lead in building stable and reliable production systems that are fit for purpose
and scale.

Becoming a Senior Engineer is a challenging step up from “Engineer III”, and with it comes new responsibilities and expectations.
Not every engineer will want to reach a Senior level, but Monzo will always need engineers at this level and there will be opportunities
to progress to this point should someone be willing and able.

11

Senior Engineer I (Level 50)
Scope:

🎨 Large or complex projects and features

Summary: An experienced individual contributor that is starting to lead large, complex projects or features, or changes to
existing features.
A “Senior Engineer I” is able to take on technical problems related to their team and works harmoniously with their whole team to
help it reach its goals. They can be relied upon to independently lead on the design and implementation of complex features and own
the delivery of big projects, or big changes to existing systems or product surfaces either by themselves or with other engineers. They
lead by example when it comes to quality production systems that can be maintained and managed with ease, good documentation,
alerts and runbooks are inherently linked with their delivery.
Being both very technically competent and able to articulate challenging technical topics with stakeholders they consistently direct
their impact to the highest leverage areas, whether it be mentoring and bringing up others in the team, or driving challenging
architecture changes and refactorings. It should be clear to see how a “Senior I” engineer has contributed to a team achieving their
goals for a half.
Giving an indication of how long we expect progression through any level is hard, it's always on a case-by-case basis (depending on
individual performance and impact), but we most commonly see 1-2 years.

Impact
Contributes to their team or domain meeting goals through successfully leading and consistently delivering on projects of
ambiguous scope and/or high complexity.
Proactively contributes to the betterment of other engineers in the company, through sponsoring, mentoring and providing
constructive, candid feedback.

Senior Engineer II (Level 60)
Scope:

🎨 Large or complex projects and features with widespread impact across an area

Summary: An experienced individual contributor with a track record of leading large, complex projects and holds the
software quality bar for their team.
A “Senior Engineer II” is a multiplier for any team. They are able to independently own ill-defined, highly ambiguous projects, driving
forward not only the implementation of the work but also the design of the solution. Thinking holistically across Product, Design,
Platform and Operations they are able to identify, coordinate and deliver a highly impactful solution to any problem, leading engineers
around them and able to manage complex stakeholder scenarios. They are heavily involved in designing elegant solutions to complex
problems and roadmaps to tackle them incrementally.
A “Senior Engineer II” has a demonstrable impact on the quality, correctness and suitability of their team’s work. The scope and
impact of a “Senior Engineer II” is evident at the team level, with their influence clearly having impact across their collective and
beginning to impact across the wider business. A “Senior Engineer II” will meaningfully contribute to setting team goals, working
collaboratively across all disciplines. They meaningfully meet those goals during a quarter or half.
They work with the whole team to ship solutions whilst maintaining the bar for quality and execution. A “Senior Engineer II” also
brings distinct individual strengths, is self-aware of what these are, and are impactful through these. They are strong mentors, role

17

Staff Engineer (Level 70) / Senior Staff Engineer (Level 80)
Scope:

🍱 Collective or Discipline

Summary: A highly experienced individual leader, leading in a large domain or collective.
Staff and Senior Staff are senior leadership roles within Monzo. The engineer should be highly confident in the role that they can
personally play to be instrumental in helping Monzo achieve our collective and business goals. They do this by focusing on high
impact, high value work which likely involves our largest and most ambiguous problems, and by breaking down large long-term
projects and mobilising teams to deliver them.
As an engineer they’re a technical authority at Monzo, with influence and respect across multiple teams, disciplines and projects.
They proactively drive cross-team initiatives, championing our engineering principles and guiding others through pragmatic technical
choices and trade-offs. They actively help lead engineering technology strategy for their Collective or Discipline, not only in the
present, but for the future.
Progression to Staff will be possible for many engineers at Monzo, but the opportunities to do so will be more limited, taking into
account their discipline and area of the company.
Impact
Meaningfully contributes to achieving company and collective goals and directly increases the company’s value over time.

Principal engineer (Level 90)
Scope:

🏦 Company

Summary: An engineering leader having impact across a broad area of the company, wider than a single collective or
discipline.
As a “Principal engineer” will be leading on technical initiatives which directly address Monzo’s most important needs, beyond a
single Collective or Discipline. To do this, they’ll be setting high level vision and strategy, and directly using their engineering
knowledge and abilities to create solutions to our most challenging problems.
They’re respected by both the wider Monzo engineering community, and the industry at large, because their past impact speaks for
itself, both from work where they’ve been involved directly, and through appropriately working through others.
To move to and progress through this level they’ll be on an individual journey and their progression and goals will be very bespoke.
These will be agreed with their line manager and other senior leaders around the business. There will be a difference between an
engineer being a general Principal engineer, and one who is doing a very specific job (e.g. VP Architecture). Progression to Principal is
not a given, and depends on having a specialism or unique skill that is critical to the company.
Impact
Able to significantly and directly impact both Monzo’s success, and the success of Engineering as a discipline across the company
(spanning more than individual sub-disciplines such as purely web, mobile, backend).
Impact is lasting - their work not only sets the business up well for the future, but also leaves a legacy to ensure that large
problems only have to be revisited at an appropriate cadence.

21

The scale of their impact is felt business-wide, and they do this by acting as a multiplier (e.g. creating systems, tools, or introducing
policies or patterns) to raise productivity, performance, and control.
